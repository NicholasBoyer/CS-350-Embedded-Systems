# CS-350-Embedded-Systems
Showcase of work from CS-350 Emerging Systems and Architecture
# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Use embedded systems coding practices to simulate a thermostat on the TI CC3320S-LAUNCHXL development board.
# What did you do particularly well?
My program successfully initiated and used the necessary peripherals. It performed the correct, intended behavior.
# Where could you improve?
There is much to be learned about the low-level use of system peripherals such as the Timer and UART.
# What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Official TI documentation and the GNU C manula were very helpful.
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
C programming and task and state machine diagraming can be applied to wide range of applications.
# How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Adherence to standards, use of patterns, and purposeful documentation ensured project maintainability, readability, and adaptability.
